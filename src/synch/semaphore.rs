///
/// ```
///
/// // Create a semaphore that represents 5 resources
/// let sem = Semaphore::new(5);
///
/// // Acquire one of the resources
/// sem.acquire();
///
/// // Acquire one of the resources for a limited period of time
/// {
///     let _guard = sem.access();
///     // ...
/// } // resources is released here
///
/// // Release our initially acquired resource
/// sem.release();
