_libhermit-rs_ is the kernel of the [RustyHermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit) unikernel project.

## Requirements

* [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [NASM](https://nasm.us/) (only for SMP on x86_64)

## Building the kernel

Usually the kernel will be linked as static library to your applications.

- **Rust applications:** Instructions can be found in the [rusty-hermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit) repository.
- **For C/C++ applications:** Instructions can be found in the [hermit-playground](https://github.com/hermitcore/hermit-playground) repository.
 

### Standalone static library build

```sh
cargo xtask build --arch x86_64
```

On completion, the script will print the path of `libhermit.a`.
If you want to build _libhermit-rs_ for aarch64, please replace `x86_64` by `aarch64`.

### Control the kernel messages verbosity

_libhermit-rs_ uses the lightweight logging crate [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log) to print kernel messages.
The environment variable `HERMIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER` controls the verbosity. 
You can change it by setting it at compile time to a string matching the name of a [LevelFilter](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.8/log/enum.LevelFilter.html).
If the variable is not set, or the name doesn't match, then `LevelFilter::Info` is used by default.

```sh
$ HERMIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER=Debug cargo xtask build --arch x86_64
```

## Credits

_libhermit-rs_ is derived from following tutorials and software distributions:

1. Philipp Oppermann's [excellent series of blog posts][opp].
2. Erik Kidd's [toyos-rs][kidd], which is an extension of Philipp Opermann's kernel.
3. The Rust-based teaching operating system [eduOS-rs][eduos].
