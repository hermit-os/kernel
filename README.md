_libhermit-rs_ is the kernel of the [RustyHermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit) unikernel project.

## Building the kernel

Usually the kernel will be linked as static library to your applications.

- **Rust applications:** Instructions can be found in the [rusty-hermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit) repository.
- **For C/C++ applications:** Instructions can be found in the [hermit-playground](https://github.com/hermitcore/hermit-playground) repository.
 

### Standalone static library build

If this does not fit your needs and you want to build the kernel as static library to link afterwards, you need the following:

The Rust **nightly** toolchain ([official webpage](https://www.rust-lang.org/)), the source code of the Rust runtime, and llvm-tools:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools-preview
```

You can then build `libhermit-rs` with the following command

```sh
cargo build -Z build-std=core,alloc,panic_abort --target x86_64-unknown-hermit-kernel
```

The resulting library then can be found in `target/x86_64-unknown-hermit-kernel/debug/libhermit.a`


### Control the kernel messages verbosity

_libhermit-rs_ uses the lightweight logging crate [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log) to print kernel messages.
The environment variable `HERMIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER` controls the verbosity. 
You can change it by setting it at compile time to a string matching the name of a [LevelFilter](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.8/log/enum.LevelFilter.html).
If the variable is not set, or the name doesn't match, then `LevelFilter::Info` is used by default.

```sh
$ HERMIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER=Debug cargo build -Z build-std=core,alloc,panic_abort --target x86_64-unknown-hermit-kernel
```

## Credits

_libhermit-rs_ is derived from following tutorials and software distributions:

1. Philipp Oppermann's [excellent series of blog posts][opp].
2. Erik Kidd's [toyos-rs][kidd], which is an extension of Philipp Opermann's kernel.
3. The Rust-based teaching operating system [eduOS-rs][eduos].
